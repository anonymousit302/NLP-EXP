1,"Steven was a nice guy, but he graded much harder than he needed to. If you tried in the class, he wanted you to succeed. Steven offered many opportunities for help on papers. More importantly, he made people significantly better writers.",netural
1,"Steven expects a lot from the student, which seemed overwhelming at times for a 100-level course. I consider myself a strong writer, but I never got anything higher than a B on a paper. He is accessible all the time though and gives his students his home phone number. He truly cares about his students and his a pretty cool guy.",netural
1,"I am currently in this class.  I took this, because I was told it was supposed to be easier than 120.  I regret staying in this class with Rand as my Professor.

Waste of my hard earned money!",netural
