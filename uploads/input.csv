1,"Steven was a nice guy, but he graded much harder than he needed to. If you tried in the class, he wanted you to succeed. Steven offered many opportunities for help on papers. More importantly, he made people significantly better writers."
1,"Steven expects a lot from the student, which seemed overwhelming at times for a 100-level course. I consider myself a strong writer, but I never got anything higher than a B on a paper. He is accessible all the time though and gives his students his home phone number. He truly cares about his students and his a pretty cool guy."
1,"I am currently in this class.  I took this, because I was told it was supposed to be easier than 120.  I regret staying in this class with Rand as my Professor.  He is nice and pretty smart, but his grading is ridiculous.  He is the hardest grader I have ever encountered.DONT take him, if you are taking this class as a general basically. LISTEN."
2,"His class was not too bad, but he tries very hard to get the attention of his students by cracking corny jokes. I skipped class most of the time, and did not miss much. "
2,"Seems like a nice guy, but he expects you to know calculus coming into the class and doesn't give much for notes. "
2,"Annoying, not helpful. Incredibly unclear."
2,"Like others have said, he seems like a great guy, and is very willing to help his students.  That said, he spends most of every lecture period answering questions from current or previous assignments and then only lectures on new material for 10 min.  So I basically have had to teach myself the material which makes it super tough and time consuming"
2,"lecture practical is not on time "

3,"I've only been in his class for a week and I hate it! I used to love going to math class he just makes it frustrating! Lectures have nothing to do with online assignments, his notes don't even make sense, and he doesn't put any examples into action so your always clueless! Goes through things way to fast as well! Waste of my hard earned money!"
3,"He tries to crack jokes during class form time to time, some funny some others not so. His notes are a little random and not so in-depth, but he is very willing to work with you in and out side of class! Don't be afraid to ask questions!!! His tests can be easy if you study and they are not take home tests!"
3,"I only went to class the first day and the days of the tests and passed.  It is possible to not attend and pass if you just look in the book and practice a few problems before the tests. After all, attendance is not taken and you get no credits for taking math 102."

4,"A lot of people complain about what a mean professor Wayne is. If you read the textbook in depth, you will do fine. Pay attention to his little tangents sometimes, like if he's giving a biology-related example. Otherwise, tune him out and read the textbook. He's not trying to offend anyone. He's just a quirky guy."

5,"Prof. Whaley is very scatterbrained sometimes.  I hardly attended class and got a good grade.  He tests straight from the book (and uses questions from his practice exams).  Whenever I have tried to talk to him he blew me off, demanding to know why I was in his office, and that if I needed something to hurry because he has a &quot;lot to do.&quot;"
5,"no comments"
5,"While he may know the subject matter well & is knowledgeable, he often interjects his own opinions and views about things. While I don't agree with his opinions and views on certain things, I ignore those statements and comments from him. Homework generally has multiple right answers, so read carefully."
5,"Honestly, the curve is so heavy in this class that my final percent in the class was a 32% and It got me a &quot;C&quot;. I guessed on all the homework because he didn't go over anything in class. Basically just do the homework and show up to class he gives pop quizzes and those points go towards midterm and finals."
